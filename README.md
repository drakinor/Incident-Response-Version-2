# Law Firm Incident Response Tabletop Simulator
**Douglas G. Jackson, P.A. - Cybersecurity Training Platform**

**Build legal practice resilience through realistic crisis decision training.**

## Law Firm-Specific Value

Cyber incidents targeting law firms are increasing. When they happen, your response decisions in the first hours determine:
- **Financial impact**: Recovery costs, ransom demands, regulatory fines, malpractice claims
- **Client confidentiality**: Potential breaches of attorney-client privilege and confidential information
- **Legal exposure**: FIPA compliance violations, ethical rule violations, client notification obligations
- **Reputation damage**: Loss of client trust, bar discipline, professional standing

This simulator prepares your law firm team to make **fast, informed decisions under pressure** while maintaining ethical obligations and regulatory compliance.

### What It Does for Law Firms

✓ **Legal Practice Crisis Scenarios**: 7 law firm-relevant cyber incidents (client file ransomware, credential harvesting, data breach, insider threat, DDoS during filing deadlines, email compromise, malware)  
✓ **Law Firm Decision Points**: Focus on client confidentiality, ethical duties, regulatory compliance, and trust account protection  
✓ **Attorney Ethics Integration**: Built-in analysis of Florida Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 4-1.6 and client notification obligations  
✓ **Regulatory Compliance**: FIPA, HIPAA (for PI cases), and ethical rule compliance analysis in every debrief  
✓ **Law Firm Role Training**: Managing Partner, Office Manager, Legal Counsel, Trust Account Manager, etc.  
✓ **Performance Analytics**: Letter-graded debrief with legal compliance analysis and improvement recommendations  
✓ **Zero IT Burden**: One-click launcher, runs locally, no APIs or external dependencies

### Why It Matters for Law Firms

- **Team readiness validation** before incidents expose gaps in client data protection
- **Cross-functional coordination** between partners, staff, IT, and external counsel
- **Cost-effective solution** compared to consultant-led exercises ($5K-15K each)
