# Incident Response Tabletop Simulator

**Build organizational resilience through realistic crisis decision training.**

## Business Value

Cyber incidents are inevitable. When they happen, your leadership team's decisions in the first hours determine:
- **Financial impact**: Millions in recovery costs, ransom demands, regulatory fines
- **Operational continuity**: Days or weeks of disruption to core business
- **Legal exposure**: Breach notifications, compliance violations, litigation
- **Reputation damage**: Loss of stakeholder trust, media scrutiny, board accountability

This simulator prepares your executive and incident response teams to make **fast, informed decisions under pressure** before a real crisis tests them.

### What It Does

✓ **Realistic Crisis Scenarios**: 7 common cyber incidents (ransomware, phishing, data breach, insider threat, DDoS, BEC, malware)  
✓ **Executive-Level Decision Points**: Focus on business impact, legal risk, and stakeholder management—not technical minutiae  
✓ **Time Pressure Simulation**: Optional countdown timers and stakeholder interrupts mirror real incident stress  
✓ **Multi-Role Team Training**: Assign roles (Incident Commander, Legal, Communications, CFO, etc.) for realistic coordination  
✓ **Performance Analytics**: Letter-graded debrief with timeline analysis and improvement recommendations  
✓ **Zero IT Burden**: One-click launcher, runs locally, no APIs or external dependencies

### Why It Matters

**Incident preparedness is not optional.** Insurance carriers, regulators, and boards increasingly expect documented tabletop exercises. This tool provides:
- **Quarterly training compliance** with minimal staff time investment
- **Evidence of due diligence** for cyber insurance and audits
- **Team readiness validation** before incidents expose gaps
- **Cross-functional coordination** practice between IT, Legal, Finance, and Communications
- **Cost-effective solution** compared to consultant-led exercises ($5K-15K each)
