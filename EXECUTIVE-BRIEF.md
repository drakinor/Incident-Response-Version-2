# EXECUTIVE BRIEF
## Incident Response Tabletop Simulator

---

### PURPOSE

Prepare leadership and incident response teams to make fast, informed decisions during cyber incidents through realistic crisis simulation training.

---

### WHAT IT DOES

**Simulates Real Cyber Crises**
- 7 common incident types: Ransomware, Phishing, Data Breach, Insider Threat, DDoS, Business Email Compromise, Malware
- 5-8 escalating decision points per scenario
- Multi-role team coordination (Incident Commander, Legal, Communications, CFO, Operations, Security, HR)
- Time pressure and stakeholder interrupt simulations

**Delivers Performance Analytics**
- Letter-graded performance assessment (A+ to F)
- Timeline analysis of all decisions made
- Specific lessons learned and strategic recommendations
- Facilitator discussion prompts for team debrief
- Printable reports for documentation

**Requires Minimal Resources**
- One-click launcher (no technical expertise needed)
- 60-90 minute sessions (quarterly recommended)
- Runs locally (no cloud dependencies, no data transmission)
- Zero ongoing costs or subscriptions

---

### WHY IT MATTERS

**Regulatory & Insurance Compliance**
- Cyber insurance carriers increasingly require documented tabletop exercises
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 mandate incident response testing
- Board-level due diligence expectations for cyber risk management

**Financial Protection**
- Documented preparedness can reduce cyber insurance premiums 5-15%
- Trained teams reduce incident recovery time 30-50% (industry average)
- Replaces $5K-15K per external consultant-led exercise (4x/year = $20K-60K annual savings)

**Operational Readiness**
- Validates incident response plan effectiveness before real crisis
- Identifies gaps in authority, communication, and coordination
- Builds executive confidence in crisis decision-making
- Creates muscle memory for cross-functional team collaboration

**Legal & Reputation Risk**
- Demonstrates "reasonable security measures" for breach litigation defense
- Prepares communications strategy before media/parent scrutiny
- Validates compliance with breach notification requirements
- Reduces organizational liability through documented preparedness

---

### HOW IT WILL BE USED

**Quarterly Training Sessions** (Recommended)
- Schedule 60-90 minute exercises each quarter
- Rotate through different incident types (ransomware, phishing, breach, etc.)
- Include cross-functional leadership: IT, Legal, Finance, Communications, Operations, HR
- Facilitator guides discussion, team votes on decisions, debrief identifies action items

**Compliance Documentation**
- Print exercise reports for insurance carrier submission
- Maintain training logs for audit and regulatory examinations
- Demonstrate board-level risk management due diligence
- Evidence "tabletop exercise" requirement fulfillment

**Incident Response Plan Validation**
- Test whether actual IR plan procedures work under pressure
- Identify missing playbook elements or unclear authority chains
- Practice notification timelines and stakeholder communication
- Validate third-party contacts and escalation procedures

---

### RETURN ON INVESTMENT

**Quantifiable**
- Insurance premium reduction: 5-15% of $50K-150K premium = $2,500-$22,500/year
- Consultant cost avoidance: $20,000-$60,000/year (4 exercises)
- Faster recovery: 30-50% time reduction on $100K-$1M+ incident = $30K-$500K+ savings
- **Total Annual Value: $52,500-$582,500**

**Qualitative**
- Executive confidence under crisis pressure
- Cross-functional team coordination
- Board assurance of proactive risk management
- Reduced legal exposure through documented preparedness
- Validated incident response plan effectiveness

**Implementation Cost: ~$0**
- No software licensing fees
- No consultant retainers
- No cloud service subscriptions
- Minimal IT staff time (one-time setup: 30 minutes)

---

### RISK PROFILE

**Security: Low**
- Runs entirely on local machine (no data transmission)
- No internet connection required (after initial setup)
- No authentication needed (designed for closed conference room use)
- No data persistence (sessions clear on restart)

**Operational: Minimal**
- One-click launcher handles all technical requirements
- IT burden: 5 minutes per quarter to facilitate
- No ongoing maintenance or updates required
- Self-contained with all dependencies included

**Compliance: Strengthens Posture**
- Satisfies cyber insurance exercise requirements
- Demonstrates NIST/ISO compliance commitment
- Creates audit trail of preparedness activities
- Provides board-level risk management evidence

---

### RECOMMENDATION

**Immediate Pilot** (This Week)
- IT staff runs one test exercise (30 minutes)
- Validate functionality and user experience
- Identify any technical requirements

**First Executive Session** (This Month)
- Schedule 90-minute leadership tabletop
- Include: Incident Commander, Legal, Communications, CFO, Operations
- Document results for insurance/compliance files
- Identify 3-5 action items for incident response plan updates

**Quarterly Cadence** (Ongoing)
- Establish recurring calendar invites
- Rotate scenario types across quarters
- Track performance improvement over time
- Submit documentation to insurance carrier annually
